# CS320 Assignments

This repo is just a collection of all my completed cs-320 assignments.

This class was surrounded around understanding how programming languages work when it comes to interpreters, not compilers. Compilers were discussed but the
professor wrote 99% of this, and was our duty as students to interpret the lecture material and her comments to making full understanding of the content being
taught.

Don't forget to `npm i` and `npm run build`!
Or just `npm run everything` to make it so, make it go, make it test.

Also, if this stuff looks familiar and you know where it comes from, ***don't cheat. Give it an honest attempt. Work with your fellow students.***
